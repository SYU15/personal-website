# Simple personal website theme
This is a simple website template for a TechWomen alumni webinar.

This is a very barebones repo to help people get up and running with a personal landing page site while learning the fundamentals of building a basic webpage.

# Getting Started
## What to do with this repository
If you are brand new to GitHub you may want to go through the [GitHub guides](https://guides.github.com).

Here are the steps if you want to play around or use this as a base for your own website:
1. Read about [GitHub pages as a way to host your website](https://pages.github.com/) and [clone](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository) or [fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking) this repository. Or you can just copy/paste what you need (I won't judge).
2. After forking/copying this repository start by [modifying the website inside GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/articles/editing-files-in-your-repository). You can also try [making changes in the command line](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf) which is a more typical development workflow.
3. Some common changes you may want to make:
    * Changing the text in `index.html` to add your information/links
    * Adding a favicon and profile image
    * Changing the appearance of the site with CSS and/or [Bootstrap classes](https://getbootstrap.com)
4. To preview the changes you have made, you can paste the GitHub url of your `index.html` page into [html preview](http://htmlpreview.github.io/)
5. When you are ready to make your website public, set your master branch to be the [publishing source of the website](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages)

## Resources for building a webpage
There are sooo many online resources you can find and things go out of date quickly. So here are some very basic docs that I'm fairly confident will stay up to date.

2. [Intro to HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML)

These options cost more but are more powerful/flexible and easier to get up and running.
